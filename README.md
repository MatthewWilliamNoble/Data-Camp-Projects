# Data-Camp-Projects

## Overview

> [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com/home) [in their own words] offers interactive R and Python courses on topics in data science, statistics, and machine learning. Learn from a team of expert teachers in the comfort of your browser with video lessons and fun coding challenges.

This repository was created to house the end products of the various Data Camp projects I have undertaken.

**Projects** 
> Where Courses teach you new data science skills and Practice Mode helps you sharpen them, building Projects gives you hands-on experience solving real-world problems.  
>
> Designed by expert instructors, DataCamp Projects are an important step in your journey to become data fluent and help you build your data science portfolio to show employers.

### Exploring 67 Years of Lego
The [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/downloads/) database includes data on every LEGO set that has ever been sold; the names of the sets, what bricks they contained, what color the bricks were, etc. It might be small bricks, but this is big data! In this project, you will get to explore the Rebrickable database. To do this you need to know your way around `pandas` dataframes and it's recommended that you take a look at the courses [pandas Foundations](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/pandas-foundations) and [Manipulating DataFrames with pandas](https://www.datacamp.com/courses/manipulating-dataframes-with-pandas).

### Introduction to DataCamp Projects
This is an introduction to DataCamp projects. DataCamp projects allow you to apply the skills you've learned in DataCamp courses. In each project, you will carry out an end-to-end analysis, on real-world tasks, using real-world tools and workflows.

In this gentle introduction to DataCamp projects, we will walk you through the projects interface and you will learn how to work with Jupyter notebooks: an open-source web application that is great for interactive data analysis.
